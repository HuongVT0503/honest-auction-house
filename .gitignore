# These files can get HUGE. We generally ignore the intermediate build steps.

# 1. The "Powers of Tau" setup files (often 1GB+)
*.ptau

# 2. Intermediate circuit compilation files
*.r1cs
*.sym

# 3. Note on .zkey and .wasm:
# Usually, we ignore these too. However, for a student project deployed on Vercel,
# it is often easier to COMMIT the final .wasm and .zkey files so the frontend
# can read them without needing to compile circuits on the server.
# If your .zkey file is >100MB, GitHub will reject it. 
# For now, we will NOT ignore them so you can deploy easily.
# *.zkey
# *.wasm

# --- Prisma ---
# Ignore the migrations folder if you want to regenerate them, 
# but usually, we KEEP migrations. Ignore the generated client if custom output.
